      <%# Here we call render not on a string with the name of a partial, but rather on a user variable of class User;
          in this context, Rails automatically looks for a partial called _user.html.erb, which we must create.
          This is a definite improvement, but we can do even better: we can call render directly on the @users variable
          Here Rails infers that @users is a list of User objects; moreover, when called with a collection of users,
          Rails automatically iterates through them and renders each one with the _user.html.erb partial
          (inferring the name of the partial from the name of the class). %>
      <%= render @users %>
