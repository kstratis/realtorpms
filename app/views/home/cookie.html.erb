    <p><b>What are cookies?</b></p>
    <p>Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved on your computer or other devices when websites
    are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to remember you and your preferences, either for a single visit
      (through a "session cookie") or for multiple repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie").</p>

    <p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the Website, and they expire
      when you close the web browser.</p>

      you when you visit our website and also when you visit certain other websites.</p>
